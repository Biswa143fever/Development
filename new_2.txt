  Programmers develop application by breaking them into small objects.The code is easy to maintain as the objects are self contained, cohesive units developed for specific functionalities.
  The objects can be reused to perform similar logics.
  
  Object:
  
   Objects has two characteristics
   State – State of the object.
   Behavior – Behavior of the object, it changes the state of the object.
   ie: Car is a object,Speed of the car which represents the state of the car.(State)
   Operations such as start/stop the car and apply brake are behaviors of the car.
   
   The behavior “accelerate the speed” changes the car’s state “speed”.
   Real world object:
   Software objects have the same characteristics,
   State  - Stored in fields.
   Behavior – Exposed through methods. Methods changes the state of the objects
   In a net banking application where user can,
      Check account status.
      Check account balance.
      Transfer amount.
  The system will be represented with a “Account” object.
      Account Objects Characterstics:

	  Methods (Behaviors)   Fields (States)
      Check Account Status   Account Status
       Transfer Amount        Account Balance
      Check Account Balance

   Class:
   A class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created.
   Class defines the states and behavior of an object.
